| [![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/concurrencykit/ck/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/concurrencykit/ck) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/concurrencykit/ck.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/concurrencykit/ck) | [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/concurrencykit/ck.svg?branch=master)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/concurrencykit/ck) |

Compilers tested in the past include gcc, clang, cygwin, icc, mingw32, mingw64 and suncc across all supported architectures. All new architectures are required to pass the integration test and under-go extensive code review.

Continuous integration is currently enabled for the following targets:
 * `darwin/clang/x86-64`
 * `freebsd/clang/x86-64`
 * `linux/gcc/arm64`
 * `linux/gcc/x86-64`
 * `linux/clang/x86-64`
 * `linux/clang/ppc64le`

### Compile and Build

* Step 1.
        `./configure`
        For additional options try `./configure --help`

* Step 2.
        In order to compile regressions (requires POSIX threads) use
        `make regressions`. In order to compile libck use `make all` or `make`.

* Step 3.
	In order to install use `make install`
	To uninstall use `make uninstall`.

See http://concurrencykit.org/ for more information.

### Supported Architectures

Concurrency Kit supports any architecture using compiler built-ins as a fallback. There is usually a performance degradation associated with this.

Concurrency Kit has specialized assembly for the following architectures:
 * `aarch64`
 * `arm`
 * `ppc`
 * `ppc64`
 * `s390x`
 * `sparcv9+`
 * `x86`
 * `x86_64`
 
### Features

#### Concurrency Primitives

##### ck_pr

Concurrency primitives as made available by the underlying architecture, includes support for all atomic operations (natively), transactional memory, pipeline control, read-for-ownership and more.

##### ck_backoff

A simple and efficient (minimal noise) backoff function.

##### ck_cc

Abstracted compiler builtins when writing efficient concurrent data structures.

#### Safe Memory Reclamation

##### ck_epoch

A scalable safe memory reclamation mechanism with support idle threads and various optimizations that make it better than or competitive with many state-of-the-art solutions.

##### ck_hp

Implements support for hazard pointers, a simple and efficient lock-free safe memory reclamation mechanism.

#### Data Structures

##### ck_array

A simple concurrently-readable pointer array structure.

##### ck_bitmap

An efficient multi-reader and multi-writer concurrent bitmap structure.

##### ck_ring

Efficient concurrent bounded FIFO data structures with various performance trade-off. This includes specialization for single-reader, many-reader, single-writer and many-writer.

##### ck_fifo

A reference implementation of the first published lock-free FIFO algorithm, with specialization for single-enqueuer-single-dequeuer and many-enqueuer-single-dequeuer and extensions to allow for node re-use.

##### ck_hp_fifo

##### ck_hp_stack

A reference implementation of a Treiber stack with support for hazard pointers.

##### ck_stack

A reference implementation of an efficient lock-free stack, with specialized variants for a variety of memory management strategies and bounded concurrency.

##### ck_queue

A concurrently readable friendly derivative of the BSD-queue interface. Coupled with a safe memory reclamation mechanism, implement scalable read-side queues with a simple search and replace.

##### ck_hs

An extremely efficient single-writer-many-reader hash set, that satisfies lock-freedom with bounded concurrency without any usage of atomic operations and allows for recycling of unused or deleted slots. This data structure is recommended for use as a general hash-set if it is possible to compute values from keys. Learn more at https://engineering.backtrace.io/workload-specialization/ and http://concurrencykit.org/articles/ck_hs.html.

##### ck_ht

A specialization of the `ck_hs` algorithm allowing for disjunct key-value pairs.

##### ck_rhs

A variant of `ck_hs` that utilizes robin-hood hashing to allow for improved performance with higher load factors and high deletion rates.

#### Synchronization Primitives

##### ck_ec

An extremely efficient event counter implementation, a better alternative to condition variables.

##### ck_barrier

A plethora of execution barriers including: centralized barriers, combining barriers, dissemination barriers, MCS barriers, tournament barriers.

##### ck_brlock

A simple big-reader lock implementation, write-biased reader-writer lock with scalable read-side locking.

##### ck_bytelock

An implementation of bytelocks, for research purposes, allowing for (in theory), fast read-side acquisition without the use of atomic operations. In reality, memory barriers are required on the fast path.

##### ck_cohort

A generic lock cohorting interface, allows you to turn any lock into a NUMA-friendly scalable NUMA lock. There is a significant trade-off in fast path acquisition cost. Specialization is included for all relevant lock implementations in Concurrency Kit. Learn more by reading "Lock Cohorting: A General Technique for Designing NUMA Locks".

##### ck_elide

A generic lock elision framework, allows you to turn any lock implementation into an elision-aware implementation. This requires support for restricted transactional memory by the underlying hardware.

##### ck_pflock

Phase-fair reader-writer mutex that provides strong fairness guarantees between readers and writers. Learn more by reading "Spin-Based Reader-Writer Synchronization for Multiprocessor Real-Time Systems".

##### ck_rwcohort

A generic read-write lock cohorting interface, allows you to turn any read-write lock into a NUMA-friendly scalable NUMA lock. There is a significant trade-off in fast path acquisition cost. Specialization is included for all relevant lock implementations in Concurrency Kit. Learn more by reading "Lock Cohorting: A General Technique for Designing NUMA Locks".

##### ck_rwlock

A simple centralized write-biased read-write lock.

##### ck_sequence

A sequence counter lock, popularized by the Linux kernel, allows for very fast read and write synchronization for simple data structures where deep copy is permitted.

##### ck_swlock

A single-writer specialized read-lock that is copy-safe, useful for data structures that must remain small, be copied and contain in-band mutexes.

##### ck_tflock

Task-fair locks are fair read-write locks, derived from "Scalable reader-writer synchronization for shared-memory multiprocessors".
