.Dt CK_RHS_NEXT 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_rhs_next
.Nd iterate to next entry in hash set
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_rhs.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_rhs_next "ck_rhs_t *hs" "ck_rhs_iterator_t *iterator" "void **entry"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_rhs_next 3
function will increment the iterator object pointed to by
.Fa iterator
to point to the next non-empty hash set entry. If
.Fn ck_rhs_next 3
returns true then the pointer pointed to by
.Fa entry
is initialized to the current hash set key pointed to by the
.Fa iterator
object.
.Pp
It is expected that
.Fa iterator
has been initialized using the
.Xr ck_rhs_iterator_init 3
function or statically initialized using CK_RHS_ITERATOR_INITIALIZER.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fn ck_rhs_next 3
returns true then the object pointed to by
.Fa entry
points to a valid hash set key. If
.Fn ck_rhs_next 3
returns false then the value of the object pointed to by
.Fa entry
is undefined.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if
.Fa iterator
or
.Fa hs
are uninitialized.
