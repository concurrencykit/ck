.Dt CK_RWCOHORT_INSTANCE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm CK_RWCOHORT_INSTANCE
.Nd declare an instance of a cohort-based reader-writer lock type
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_cohort.h
.Fn CK_RWCOHORT_NEUTRAL_INSTANCE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Fn CK_RWCOHORT_RP_INSTANCE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Fn CK_RWCOHORT_WP_INSTANCE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The user must use this macro to declare instances of lock types that they have
defined using the
.Xr CK_RWCOHORT_PROTOTYPE 3
macro.  The cohort_name must be the same as the one used in the prototype macro.
For instance, if CK_RWCOHORT_PROTOTYPE was called with the name "foo", the
CK_RWCOHORT_INSTANCE macro should be called as
.br
CK_RWCOHORT_INSTANCE(foo) cohort;
.Pp
This macro should also be used when allocating memory for cohorts.  For instance,
to allocate a block of 4 cohorts:
.br
CK_RWCOHORT_WP_INSTANCE(foo) *cohorts = malloc(4 * sizeof(CK_RWCOHORT_WP_INSTANCE(foo)));
