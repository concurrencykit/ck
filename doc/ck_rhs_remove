.Dt CK_RHS_REMOVE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_rhs_remove
.Nd remove key from a hash set
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_rhs.h
.Ft void *
.Fn ck_rhs_remove "ck_rhs_t *hs" "unsigned long hash" "const void *key"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_rhs_remove 3
function will attempt to remove the key specified by the
.Fa key
argument in the hash set pointed to by the
.Fa hs
argument. The key specified by
.Fa key
is expected to have the hash value specified by the
.Fa hash
argument (which was previously generated using the
.Xr CK_RHS_HASH 3
macro).
.Pp
If the call to
.Fn ck_rhs_remove 3
was successful then the key contained in the hash
set is returned. If the key was not a member of the hash
set then
.Dv  NULL
is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn ck_rhs_remove 3
returns a pointer to a key and otherwise returns
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if
.Fa key
or
.Fa hs
are uninitialized.
