.Dt CK_RHS_INIT 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_rhs_init
.Nd initialize a hash set
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_rhs.h
.Ft typedef unsigned long
.Fn ck_rhs_hash_cb_t "const void *key" "unsigned long seed"
.Ft typedef bool
.Fn ck_rhs_compare_cb_t "const void *c1" "const void *c2"
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_rhs_init "ck_rhs_t *hs" "unsigned int mode" "ck_rhs_hash_cb_t *hash_function" "ck_rhs_compare_cb_t *compare" "struct ck_malloc *allocator" "unsigned long capacity" "unsigned long seed"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_rhs_init
function initializes the hash set pointed to by the
.Fa hs
pointer.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa mode
specifies the type of key-value pairs to be stored in the
hash set as well as the expected concurrent access model.
The value of
.Fa mode
consists of a bitfield of one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It CK_RHS_MODE_OBJECT
The hash set is meant to store pointers to objects. This provides
a hint that only CK_MD_VMA_BITS are necessary to encode the key
argument. Any unused pointer bits are leveraged for internal
optimizations.
.It CK_RHS_MODE_DIRECT
The hash set is meant to directly store key values and that all
bits of the key are used to encode values.
.It CK_RHS_MODE_READ_MOSTLY
Optimize read operations over put/delete.
.El
.Pp
The concurrent access model is specified by:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It CK_RHS_MODE_SPMC
The hash set should allow for concurrent readers in the
presence of a single writer.
.It CK_RHS_MODE_MPMC
The hash set should allow for concurrent readers in the
presence of concurrent writers. This is currently unsupported.
.El
.Pp
The developer is free to specify additional workload hints.
These hints are one of:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.El
.Pp
The argument
.Fa hash_function
is a mandatory pointer to a user-specified hash function.
A user-specified hash function takes two arguments. The
.Fa key
argument is a pointer to a key. The
.Fa seed
argument is the initial seed associated with the hash set.
This initial seed is specified by the user in
.Xr ck_rhs_init 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fa compare
argument is an optional pointer to a user-specified
key comparison function. If NULL is specified in this
argument, then pointer equality will be used to determine
key equality. A user-specified comparison function takes
two arguments representing pointers to the objects being
compared for equality. It is expected to return true
if the keys are of equal value and false otherwise.
.Pp
The
.Fa allocator
argument is a pointer to a structure containing
.Fa malloc
and
.Fa free
function pointers which respectively define the memory allocation and
destruction functions to be used by the hash set being initialized.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa capacity
represents the initial number of keys the hash
set is expected to contain. This argument is simply a hint
and the underlying implementation is free to allocate more
or less memory than necessary to contain the number of entries
.Fa capacity
specifies.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa seed
specifies the initial seed used by the underlying hash function.
The user is free to choose a value of their choice.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion
.Fn ck_rhs_init
returns a value of
.Dv true
and otherwise returns a value of
.Dv false
to indicate an error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.Pp
The behavior of
.Fn ck_rhs_init
is undefined if
.Fa hs
is not a pointer to a
.Tn ck_rhs_t
object.
