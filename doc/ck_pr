.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_pr
.Nd concurrency primitives interface
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_pr.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
ck_pr.h provides an interface to volatile atomic instructions,
memory barriers and busy-wait facilities as provided by the
underlying processor. The presence of an atomic operation
is detected by the presence of a corresponding CK_F_PR macro.
For example, the availability of
.Xr ck_pr_add_16 3
would be determined by the presence of CK_F_PR_ADD_16.
