.Dt CK_RWCOHORT_PROTOTYPE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm CK_RWCOHORT_PROTOTYPE
.Nd define reader-writer cohort-based lock using the specified cohort type
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_rwcohort.h
.Fn CK_RWCOHORT_NEUTRAL_PROTOTYPE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Fn CK_RWCOHORT_RP_PROTOTYPE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Fn CK_RWCOHORT_WP_PROTOTYPE "COHORT_NAME cohort_name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The ck_rwcohort.h header file does not define any cohort types.  Instead, the user must use
the CK_RWCOHORT_PROTOTYPE macro to define any types they want to use.
This macro takes a single argument which corresponds to the type of the cohort lock that
the reader-writer lock should use.  A cohort type must have already been defined with that name
using the
.Xr CK_COHORT_PROTOTYPE 3
or
.Xr CK_COHORT_TRYLOCK_PROTOTYPE 3
macros.
.Pp
Instances of the defined lock type can be declared as:
.br
    CK_RWCOHORT_INSTANCE(cohort_name) lock;
