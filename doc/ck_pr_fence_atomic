.Dt CK_PR_FENCE_ATOMIC 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_pr_fence_atomic
.Nd enforce partial ordering of atomic read-modify-write operations
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_pr.h
.Ft void
.Fn ck_pr_fence_atomic void
.Ft void
.Fn ck_pr_fence_strict_atomic void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_pr_fence_atomic
function enfores the ordering of any
atomic read-modify-write operations relative to
the invocation of the function. This function
always serve as an implicit compiler barrier. On
architectures implementing CK_MD_TSO, this operation
only serves as a compiler barrier and no fences
are emitted. On architectures implementing
CK_MD_PSO and CK_MD_RMO, a store fence is
emitted. To force the unconditional emission of
a fence, use
.Fn ck_pr_fence_strict_atomic .
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal -offset indent

#include <ck_pr.h>

static int a = 0;
static int b = 0;
static int c = 0;

void
function(void)
{

	ck_pr_fas_int(&a, 1);

	/*
	 * Guarantee that the update to a is completed
	 * with respect to the updates of b and c.
	 */
	ck_pr_fence_atomic();
	ck_pr_fas_int(&b, 2);
	ck_pr_fas_int(&c, 2);

	return;
