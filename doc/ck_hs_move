.Dt CK_HS_MOVE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_hs_move
.Nd move one from hash set to another
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_hs.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_hs_move "ck_hs_t *destination" "ck_hs_t *source" "ck_hs_hash_cb_t *hash_cb" "ck_hs_compare_cb_t *compare_cb" "struct ck_malloc *m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_hs_move 3
function will initialize
.Fa source
from
.Fa destination .
The hash function is set to
.Fa hash_cb ,
comparison function to
.Fa compare_cb
and the allocator callbacks to
.Fa m .
Further modifications to
.Fa source
will result in undefined behavior. Concurrent
.Xr ck_hs_get 3
and
.Xr ck_hs_fas 3
operations to
.Fa source
are legal until the next write operation to
.Fa destination .
.Pp
This operation moves ownership from one hash set object
to another and re-assigns callback functions to developer-specified
values. This allows for dynamic configuration of allocation
callbacks and is necessary for use-cases involving executable code
which may be unmapped underneath the hash set.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion
.Fn ck_hs_move 3
returns true and otherwise returns false to indicate an error.
