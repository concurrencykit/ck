.Dt CK_BAG_INIT 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ck_bag_init
.Nd initialize ck_bag
.Sh LIBRARY
Concurrency Kit (libck, \-lck)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_bag.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_bag_init "struct ck_bag *bag" "size_t n_cachelines" "enum ck_bag_allocation_strategy as"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Fn ck_bag_init
function will initialize the object pointed to by the
.Fa bag
argument. If the 
.Fa n_cachelines
argument is equivalent to CK_BAG_DEFAULT, then the block_size for the bag will
be CK_BAG_PAGESIZE (CK_MD_PAGESIZE). Otherwise, the block_size for the bag will
be n_cachelines * CK_MD_CACHELINE. The block_size, the number of bytes in a 
single ck_bag_block, is set on a bag basis.
.Pp
.Fn ck_bag_init
will return false if the calculated block_size is less than the number of bytes
required by block overhead. Block overhead includes any allocator overhead 
established from a previous call to the
.Fn ck_bag_allocator_set
function.
.Fn ck_bag_init 
will also return false if you have compiled ck to pointer pack
and the number of entries within a block is greater than CK_BAG_MAX_N_ENTRIES.
On x86_64, CK_BAG_MAX_N_ENTRIES is equal to 4096.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fn ck_bag_init 
returns true then the object pointed to by the
.Fa bag
argument has been initialized. Otherwise, the object pointed to by the
.Fa bag
argument is not a valid ck_bag.
.Sh ERRORS
Behavior is undefined if 
.Fa bag
does not point to a valid ck_bag object or if ck_bag_allocator_set has not been
called previously.
