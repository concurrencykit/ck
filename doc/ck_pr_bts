.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ck_pr.h
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_pr_bts_ptr "void *target" "unsigned int bit_index"
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_pr_bts_uint "uint *target" "unsigned int bit_index"
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_pr_bts_int "int *target" "unsigned int bit_index"
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_pr_bts_64 "uint64_t *target" "unsigned int bit_index"
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_pr_bts_32 "uint32_t *target" "unsigned int bit_index"
.Ft bool
.Fn ck_pr_bts_16 "uint16_t *target" "unsigned int bit_index"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ck_pr_bts 3
family of functions atomically fetch the value
of the bit in
.Fa target
at index
.Fa bit_index
and set that bit to 1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This family of functions returns the original value of
the bit at offset
.Fa bit_index
that is in the value pointed to by
.Fa target .
